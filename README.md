Code with us; Raonjena coding event 

Greetings Earthlings! Welcome to the first Code With Us event here at Raonjena.

I created this event so that I could code on a project with some other folks, mainly to support my foundational coding. You are welcome to be as creative as you’d like with the assignment below, but please keep things PG. If this is a cakewalk for you, I encourage you to highlight some of your advanced coding knowledge. Don’t forget to push commits and sync your changes so others can follow along with your updated code. 

This is meant to be fun! Enjoy
